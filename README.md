## Potential Areas

The GDP of the four regions in 2022 is fairly even, but the South region shows a slight advantage compared to the others. Additionally, the South region is increasingly becoming the industrial heartland of the U.S., attracting numerous investors.

-> Proposed to select the South region for investment.

## Warehouse Density in the South Region by State

1. The number of properties is concentrated in larger states such as Texas, Florida, and North Carolina. These states also have high GDPs in the U.S.

-> High GDP indicates that these states have many companies and investment potential. However, the high number of properties also implies greater competition.

2. In terms of size, small warehouses are the most common in each state.

-> This proportion reflects the actual market demand for small warehouses. Large and medium warehouses account for a smaller proportion and primarily meet storage needs for specific types of goods requiring large spaces.

# 6. Conclusions and Recommendations
- Consider investing in Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama, and Mississippi, focusing on the small warehouse segment (the most common type). However, economic conditions, income levels, and the number of companies in these regions should be considered before making a decision.
- The average rental price for small warehouses will range from 0.42 to 0.92.
- Investing in large and medium-sized warehouses may avoid competition, but the market demand should be assessed before investing in this type of property.
- For other states:
1. Consider investing in larger states despite high market share competition. Potential solutions may include modifying the warehouse model to incorporate cold storage or intelligent warehouse management technology.
2. Consider the price point to (i) ensure competitiveness with renovated warehouses that offer attractive prices and (ii) remain within the budget plan.
3. Real estate market prices across all sizes tend to increase with more recent construction years. Management can calculate appropriate prices to compete, attract customers who prefer good prices and guaranteed building quality.
